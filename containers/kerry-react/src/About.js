        Bounce a quarter off the table! If it lands in the right side of
        the tray, take that many sips. If it lands in the left side, give
        that many sips to someone else. If it lands in the pot, the last
        person to moose drinks the whole pot. If anyone false mooses, they
        have to drink the pot.
